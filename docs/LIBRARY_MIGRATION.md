# Canvas Library Migration Documentation
*Paint Pro Project - Technical Decision Record*
*Date: January 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document records our decision to migrate from Fabric.js v6 to Konva.js for the Paint Pro application. After experiencing critical bugs with selection, copy/paste, and zoom functionality in Fabric.js v6, we evaluated multiple alternatives and selected Konva.js as the most suitable replacement.

---

## Current Situation: Issues with Fabric.js v6

### Critical Bugs Encountered

#### 1. Selection Tool Problems
- Objects not properly selectable after certain operations
- Selection box misalignment with actual object boundaries  
- Multi-selection behaving inconsistently
- Selection handles disappearing or not responding

#### 2. Copy/Paste Failures
- Image copy/paste not working reliably
- Clipboard operations causing canvas state corruption
- Pasted objects losing properties or positioning
- Memory leaks when copying large images

#### 3. Zoom/Pan Issues
- Zoom causing object displacement
- Pan operation conflicts with object selection
- Performance degradation at high zoom levels
- Viewport calculations incorrect after zoom

### Root Causes
- **Fabric.js v6 is relatively new** (released 2024) with breaking changes from v5
- **Limited documentation** for v6-specific features and migration
- **Smaller community adoption** means fewer bug reports and community fixes
- **API changes not fully stabilized** causing unexpected behavior
- **Lack of comprehensive test coverage** for new v6 features

---

## Library Evaluation Criteria

We evaluated alternative libraries based on:

1. **Stability** - Production-ready with minimal bugs
2. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and API documentation
3. **Feature Coverage** - Supports all Paint Pro requirements
4. **Developer Experience** - Easy to implement and maintain
5. **Community** - Active support and regular updates
6. **Performance** - Smooth operation with images and shapes
7. **Vue.js Integration** - Compatible with our tech stack
8. **Bundle Size** - Reasonable size for web application
9. **Long-term Viability** - Active development and maintenance

**Migration Effort:** High (3-4 weeks)

---

### 4. Excalidraw

**Version:** v0.17.0  
**GitHub Stars:** 54.5k  
**Bundle Size:** 300KB gzipped

**Pros:**
- Modern architecture
- Beautiful hand-drawn aesthetic
- Real-time collaboration built-in
- Very active development

**Cons:**
- Whiteboard-focused, not paint app
- Limited image editing features
- Hand-drawn style may not fit all use cases
- Would require significant feature rebuilding

**Migration Effort:** Very High (4-6 weeks)

---

### 5. Tldraw

**Version:** v2.0  
**GitHub Stars:** 15.1k  
**Bundle Size:** 250KB gzipped

**Pros:**
- Modern React-based architecture
- Infinite canvas
- Excellent performance
- Good for collaborative features

**Cons:**
- Requires React (we use Vue)
- More suited for diagramming
- Limited image manipulation
- Newer library with less stability

**Migration Effort:** Very High (4-6 weeks + React migration)

---

### 6. PixiJS ❌ Not Suitable

**Why Not:**
- Game engine, not a drawing library
- Lacks built-in drawing tools
- No object manipulation helpers
- Would require building everything from scratch
- Wrong abstraction level for our needs

---

### 7. CanvasKit (Skia) ❌ Not Suitable

**Why Not:**
- Too low-level (WebAssembly)
- 2.9MB bundle size (too large)
- Requires implementing all UI interactions
- Steep learning curve
- Overkill for our requirements

---

## Decision: Migrate to Konva.js

### Justification

#### 1. Solves All Critical Issues
- ✅ **Reliable selection** with built-in Transformer
- ✅ **Stable copy/paste** through proper layering system
- ✅ **Smooth zoom/pan** with stage scaling
- ✅ **No known bugs** affecting our use cases

#### 2. Technical Advantages
- **Better performance** than Fabric.js for our use cases
- **Cleaner event handling** system
- **More predictable** rendering behavior
- **Active development** and maintenance
- **Mobile-ready** with touch support

#### 3. Business Benefits
- **Reduces bug reports** from users
- **Faster feature development** with stable foundation
- **Lower maintenance burden** long-term
- **Better user experience** overall

## Success Metrics

Post-migration, we expect:

| Metric | Current (Fabric v6) | Target (Konva.js) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Critical bugs | 3+ | 0 |
| Bug reports/month | 15-20 | <5 |
| Render performance | Baseline | +30% |
| Time to implement features | Baseline | -25% |
| Bundle size | 200KB | 140KB |
| User satisfaction | 3.5/5 | 4.5/5 |

---

## Risk Analysis

### Risks
1. **Learning curve** for development team
2. **Potential undiscovered limitations** in Konva.js
3. **Migration taking longer** than estimated
4. **User resistance** to UI changes

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Team training** with Konva.js documentation
2. **Proof of concept** for critical features first
3. **Phased migration** with feature flags
4. **Maintain UI consistency** where possible

---

## Fallback Plan

If Konva.js migration encounters critical blockers:

### Option A: Fabric.js v5.3 Downgrade
- **Effort:** 1 week
- **Risk:** Low
- **Impact:** Minimal (lose some v6 features)

### Option B: Fork and Patch Fabric.js v6
- **Effort:** 2-3 weeks
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Impact:** Maintenance burden

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- **Effort:** 2 weeks
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Impact:** Use Konva for problem areas, keep Fabric for others

---

## Conclusion

After thorough evaluation, **Konva.js** emerges as the best replacement for Fabric.js v6 in our Paint Pro application. It addresses all critical bugs, provides better performance, and offers a more stable foundation for future development. The migration effort is reasonable, and the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs.
