# Konva Migration Issues - Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ **Mouse Position Offset Issue**
**Problem:** Starting point when drawing or drag selecting was incorrect, with significant distance from initial mousedown event.

**Solution:** Fixed pointer position calculation in `useKonvaStage.ts` by accounting for stage transformation:
```typescript
const getPointerPosition = () => {
  if (!stage.value) return null;
  const transform = stage.value.getAbsoluteTransform().copy();
  transform.invert();
  const pos = stage.value.getPointerPosition();
  if (!pos) return null;
  return transform.point(pos);
};
```

### 2. ✅ **Text Editing Double Element Issue**
**Problem:** Double-clicking to edit text showed duplicate elements with different colors, and changes appended to old text instead of replacing it.

**Solution:** Improved text editing in `useKonvaDrawing.ts`:
- Hide original text while editing
- Remove any existing textarea before creating new one
- Use unique ID for textarea element
- Properly show/hide text node
- Account for stage scale when positioning textarea
- Add visual styling to textarea for better UX

### 3. ✅ **Line/Arrow Drawing Preview**
**Problem:** When dragging to draw line or arrow, no preview was shown during drawing, only appearing when finished.

**Solution:** Added real-time preview in `KonvaCanvasEditor.vue`:
- Create temporary shape on mousedown for all shape tools
- Update shape coordinates/dimensions during mousemove
- Show preview for line, arrow, and rectangle tools
- Remove temp shape and create final shape on mouseup

### 4. ✅ **Color/Size Changes for Selected Objects**
**Problem:** Changing color and size only applied to new elements, not to currently selected objects.

**Solution:** Added reactive property updates in `KonvaCanvasEditor.vue`:
- Watch color/size changes and apply to selected objects
- Update stroke for lines, arrows, rectangles
- Update fill for text elements
- Show current object properties when selected
- Automatically update toolbar values based on selected object

## Additional Improvements

- **Better visual feedback** during all operations
- **Consistent behavior** across all tools
- **Improved UX** with proper previews and instant property updates
- **Type safety** maintained throughout fixes

## Testing Checklist

✅ Text editing works without duplicates
✅ Line/arrow preview visible while drawing
✅ Color changes apply to selected objects
✅ Size changes apply to selected strokes
✅ Selection shows object's current properties
✅ All tools work with zoom/pan
